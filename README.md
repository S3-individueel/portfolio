## 1 Web application

You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

Clarification:

User friendly: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.


### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

For this project I'll be making a full stack application with a React frontend using TypeScript for some extra software quality. The web API will be build with ASP.NET Web API core. The API is connected with an Azure hosted SQL database through Entity Framework core.
